print(10 + 3)
# we have addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. There are two division operators:
# / and //. One slash returns a floating point #. // returns an integer, a whole #
# modulus operator = %. RETURNS THE REMAINDER
# exponent operator = **. aka (10 ** 3) would be 10000.
# augmented assignment operator:
x = 10
x = x + 3
x += 3
# same as in Java. can also do -= and *=, etc.
