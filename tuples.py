# tuples are sort of like lists, used to store a range of objects.
# tuples are IMMUTABLE, we cannot change them once created
numbers = (1, 2, 3)
# you couldnt try to change the tuple by inserting an element
#tuple methods: count( returns # of occurrences)
numbers.count(3)
# index = returns first element of given tuple
# most of the time we would use lists, but if we don't want it modified, we use a tuple.
